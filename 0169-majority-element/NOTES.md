â€‹Okay, so we're given an array, and we want to find the majority element. I notice that the majority element will always exist in the array, so that makes things a bit simpler.

First, I need to consider edge cases. If the array has only one element, that element is the majority by default, so I handle that case first.

Now, for the main logic. I remember the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm is a neat approach for finding the majority element in linear time. I initialize a candidate and a count. These will represent the potential majority element and its count.

I start iterating through the array from the second element because I've already handled the case where there's only one element. For each element, I check if the count is zero. If it is, I update the candidate to the current element because it might become the majority.

Then, I update the count based on whether the current element is equal to the candidate. If it is, I increment the count; otherwise, I decrement it. This mimics the idea of canceling out occurrences of different elements.

Finally, I return the candidate, but I note that at this point, it's a potential majority element. To be sure, I might want to perform a second pass through the array to count its occurrences.

So, this solution seems efficient with O(n) time complexity and no additional space requirements. It's a nice balance of simplicity and effectiveness for finding the majority element.
